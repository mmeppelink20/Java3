# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-181 Java III course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Chapters 1 and 2

in chapters 1 and 2 in Java 3, we primarily learned about the Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and multi-tiered applications, and web containers. 
The Java Enterprise Edition is a specification that describes how web servers interact with Java web technologies like Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP).
A web application, which on the surface is quite self-explanator, is a type of application where a user can interact with an application on a server from their
own computer. We employed these concepts through a Java Servlet Container called Apache Tomcat.
